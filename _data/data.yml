  summary: |
    I’m a passionate Software Engineer working currently at Capital One. I truly enjoy the process of problem-solving and rethinking solutions for problems. I find myself mostly on my computer writing code, reading articles on Medium and LinkedIn, scrolling Reddit feed, and watching educational videos.<br>Other than technology, I like being out in nature. I like hiking, taking a walk in the park and taking beautiful pictures of nature.
