  title: About Me
  summary: |
    I’m a passionate Software Engineer working currently at Capital One. I truly enjoy the process of problem-solving and rethinking existing solutions to problems. I find myself mostly on my computer writing code, reading articles on Medium and LinkedIn, watching educational videos, etc. I put my time on energy every day on making myself better than I was yesterday.<br><br>Other than working with technology, I like being out in nature. I like hiking, taking a walk in the park and taking beautiful pictures of nature.
